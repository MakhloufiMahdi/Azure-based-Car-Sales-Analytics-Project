## ðŸ“Š Chart 1: Sales by Company
This chart reflects brand dominance in terms of unit sales. Chevrolet, Dodge, and Ford lead the market, indicating strong dealership networks or consumer trust. Mercedes-Benzâ€™s presence in the top 5 suggests premium models are also selling well in volume, which is unusual and may reflect aggressive pricing or leasing strategies. 
## ðŸ“ŠChart 2: Average of Price by Company
 This chart reveals the premium positioning of certain brands. Cadillac leads with the highest average price, reinforcing its luxury status. Saab and Lexus follow closely, suggesting strong brand equity. Buick and Oldsmobile, traditionally mid-range, show elevated pricingâ€”possibly due to newer models or bundled features. 
## ðŸ“ŠChart 3: Sales by Year and Month
 Thereâ€™s a clear decline in monthly sales from 2022 to 2023. This could indicate market saturation, economic slowdown, or reduced promotional activity. The peak in Oct 2022 suggests seasonal campaigns or new model releases. 
## ðŸ“Š Chart 4: Sales by Transmission
Manual transmissions slightly dominate, which is atypical in many markets. This could reflect regional preferences, cost sensitivity, or a younger buyer demographic. 
## ðŸ“ŠChart 5 : Sales by Gender
This chart shows the distribution of vehicle purchases by gender. The data reveals a clear imbalance: approximately 79% of sales are made by male customers, while 21% come from female buyers. This suggests that the market is predominantly male-driven, which could reflect broader trends in car ownership, marketing focus, or purchasing behavior.
