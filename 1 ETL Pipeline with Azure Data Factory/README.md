This ETL pipeline, built using Azure Data Factory, automates the ingestion and transformation of car sales data stored in a CSV file within Azure Blob Storage. The pipeline begins by retrieving the raw data and passing it through a Data Flow activity, where it applies basic transformations such as filtering, sorting, and renaming columns to ensure consistency and readability. Once the data is cleaned, it is loaded into a structured SQL table (CarSales) hosted on Azure SQL Database. The pipeline is designed to run on a scheduled basis, ensuring that the data remains up to date. While the architecture is straightforward and low-code, it provides a reliable and scalable solution for integrating flat file data into a relational database, making it suitable for reporting and dashboarding purposes.
